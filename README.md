## Knight's tour

[Knight's tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour) is a sequence of moves on a chessboard.
 The knight should touch each of the 64 squares once and only once.This is my attempt at solving that problem.


## Simple Heuristic: Warndorff's Rule
There are multiple approaches for a solution in this case, including brute force. The wikipedia article offers multiple ideas. I find this quite interesting. What I tried to do is Warnsdorff's rule. (*"Warnsdorff's rule is a heuristic for finding a single knight's tour."*)
