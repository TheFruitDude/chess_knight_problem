## Draw the knights tour on a chess board

This is a pretty interesting example of fining a path for a specific problem.

The knights tour explained: The knight should touch each of the 64 squares once and only once. Standart chess rules are applied. To find a path for this problem is what this program is trying to achieve.

There are multiple approaches for a solution in this case, including brute force. The wikipedia article offers multiple ideas. What I tried to do is Warnsdorff's rule. (*"Warnsdorff's rule is a heuristic for finding a single knight's tour. The knight is moved so that it always proceeds to the square from which the knight will have the fewest onward moves"[wikipedia]*)
